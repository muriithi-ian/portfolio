### My lessons
<!-- What did I learn? -->
<u>Everything I learned</u>

- Running an Angular project
- Contributing to projects
- The format of writing commit messages

<u>The key lesson(s) of this week:</u>

Commit messages are written in a certain structure in order for the commit to communicate what it is dealing with and it is easily understood by anyone else working on the project.

### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was exciting and yet I was still afraid because this is a new journey I am taking to having experience in real world projects and I did not know what I would face.

- I find the project to be exciting and also it challenges me.

- My level of stress is manageable.
